If price is low it will not give you any taste. Best Sandwich always best price. Love the way they making and the price. Burgerology is the best Burger in Bangladesh even the Burger King.

From Birthday parties to regular hangouts burgerology is favourite not only best because of the taste but also their professionalism. Whenever we entered to burgerology someone must have wished us good evening or good day. And when we go out they said thank you. When burgerology was first opened in Bashundhara right beside genius the owner came and asekd about the taste. We all appreciated him for the sauce and best patties he made. He was so generous and kind. Though we couldn't see him much in the new branch but burgerology is great. ❤
Burgerology is my first choice.. your burger quality is just wow.. the environment and food that's why burgerology is my favorite.. waiting for your surprise.. 😊
"Burgerology Burgers are love but the burger of Burgerology is my first love.whenever i go to Bashundhara gate,i never miss a chance to enjoy your juicy burgers.Burgers are so juicy and tasty🥰.But because of the lockdown i haven’t tasted your burgers since many days.It will be a great pleasure for me if i get a chance to enjoy your delicious burger 💕"

Whenever we get time we like to have your burger but due to this pandemic it has become really hard!
Miss the burger!! #burgerology"
Never tried your burgers but heard they are good!! Maybe one day will try!
"Burgerology is the number one choice for all authentic burger lovers. While many other restaurants are serving their burger with just plenty of sauces and mayonnaise, burgerology has shown the town how real burgers are. Their stuffings are so juicy and tender. The foods can undoubtedly change the mood of the eater. For all foodies it is like a burger heaven.At last, if u don’t like their burgers then YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO CALL YOURSELF A BURGER LOVER!!
#Burgerology"

I always wanted to be a lecturer of psychology..oneday I went to bergerology and then they offered me buy 1 get 1 burgers..my brain got boosted because they mix NZT 48 ...so I became limitless ...finally I am a proffesor of psychology 😁🙄

Honestly i didn’t have any item of burgerology before but i want you to surprise me with your burgers and make me a fanatic lover of burgerology ☺☺
"#Burgerology
I'm about to forget the taste of garlicology and dairy milk shake. In this quarantine after the lockdown started I thought I won't be able to taste it anymore. Even I still remember I had the last offer your bashundhara branch offered ""buy one, get one"" on first week of March. Ordered from uni via foodpanda at least twice a week. Now, After this free food offer started I felt very happy that there's at least .01% chance that I can have it from home, now dear #Burgerology please don't make me feel like ""I was happy for nothing"" plz 😓"
"I'm a fan of your bashundhara branch, from the time when you had that small little room loads of memories there, never missed any offer and item from your menu
