"You guys have good marketing strategy. But, you should focus on the quality of your food too. Day by day is going down. The burger bun seems cheap ( Tong dokan er bun. I,rather,would like to have it dipped in tea ) and quantity of the materials inside is too less. Your fries doesn't taste as it used to. The soft drinks tastes as if extra water has been added to it. So, alongside the marketing, focus on the quality. It will grab more customers for you and hold back the older ones. I was very dissatisfied on my last visit. Takeout is not the takeout as it was used to be before."

"Takeout: See your target customers mostly are students and young peoples... considering the socioeconomic condition of BD most of the student are likely to be price sensitive as most of them doesn‚Äôt work. Hence, to keep them coming you must reduce price. See burgers shouldn‚Äôt cost as much as a full meal. I‚Äôve been to 10 countries including Europe, haven‚Äôt seen fast food items are this much pricy as in BD.
Open few takeaway stores where ppl will just drop by and get takeaway.. this will reduce your outlet cost. Cheers"
